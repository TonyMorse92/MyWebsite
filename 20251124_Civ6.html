			I've played Civ 6 pretty much every week consistently for the past couple of years. 
			<br> 
			Despite the frequent play, and the even more frequent YouTube video binges, 
			<br> I still haven't beaten the game on the highest difficult yet.
			</p>
			<p> 
			I don't think this is due to lack of ability, more a lack of seeing the games through to the end.
			<br>I'm not good enough to win any match I spawn into on the highest difficulty 
			<br> (even ignoring the games where aggresive Civs spawn 15 tiles away), 
			<br>but I do think I can win a plurality given that I don't restart the first time I feel slightly bored.
			</p>
			<p>
			Now Civ 6 is a video game, whose primary utility is as a source of entertainment, so starting over when I get bored 
			<br>(pretty much everyone agrees the early game, at least against the AI, is much more fun than the latter parts) 
			<br> isn't the biggest of deals. 
			However, I tend to have an issue comitting to a path and following through to the end in a lot of areas,
			<br>and I view my frequent restarts on Civ as emblematic of a larger problem. 
			</p>
			<p> 	
			Hence, I'm giving myself a little challenge. There were about 20 original Leader/Civilization combos when Civ 6 came out.
			<br> I'm going to win at least 1 game with each. The game modes and map settings will vary, 
			<br> though I am going to refrain from the "meme" setups (e.g. Russia on a cold, wet map).		
			</p>
			<p>
			There's no hard timeline for this, though I'm expecting to be done by the end of 2026. 
			<br> I'm cutting back on video games, but I figure I can conceivably get through 1 game 
			<br> (which usually takes 4-8 hours on the shortest speed) fairly easily.
